# Stock Prediction using Linear Regression

This project aims to predict stock prices using Linear Regression, a popular machine learning algorithm.

## Overview

We've developed a model that uses Linear Regression to predict future stock prices based on historical data. This model can be a valuable tool for traders and financial analysts.

## Dataset

Our dataset consists of historical stock prices. Please replace this with the actual source or description of your dataset.

## Methodology

We've used Linear Regression, a supervised learning algorithm, for this task. Linear Regression works by fitting a linear equation to observed data. The steps to perform linear regression are:

1. Load the dataset.
2. Preprocess the data (cleaning and normalization).
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Train the Linear Regression model on the training set.
5. Evaluate the model on the testing set.

## Libraries Used
